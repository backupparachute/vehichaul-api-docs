  You need to be authenticated for all API requests. You will need to request an API token from support.

  We use Token authentication, add the API key to the Authorization header for all requests.
  
  `Authorization: Token token="{api-token}"`
  {: .info}
  
  You will also need the account subdomain, the following example is the base URL for each request:
  
  `https://{subdomain}.vehichaul.com/api/...`
  {: .info}

  Nothing will work unless you include your supplied Authorization token for each request
  {: .error}
